      "Description": "The mule dashes in a straight line 3 spaces, phasing through characters. The first foe it encounters must save or the mule moves into that foe’s space. That foe’s maximum speed is reduced to 0, it shares the mule’s space, and it moves while the mule moves. The kidnapped foe can repeat this save at the end of their turn to end this effect, placing them in an adjacent free space. It also ends if the mule is stunned or shoved."
