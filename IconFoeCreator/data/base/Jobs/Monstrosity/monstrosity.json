      "Description": "Monstrosities are built to be worthy foes for a whole party of characters. They have high hit points, abilities that can hit the whole party, and take turns after every player character turn. They have a few special rules:\n• Due to their complexity, monstrosities can take templates (Beast, Demon, Relict, etc) but can’t take sub-templates (Wight, Ghoul, Armor Demon, etc). Instead, re-flavor their abilities as you see fit.\n• Monstrosities have phases, which change up their available actions and traits. Phases trigger based on set factors. When a phase triggers, the Monstrosity becomes immune to all damage and effects until the start of its next turn.\n• Monstrosities have targetable body parts that can disable or weaken certain abilities. Body parts have the same defenses as the monstrosity but a separate pool of hit points, which doesn’t affect its main hit points. However, any damage taken to body parts when they are reduce to 0 ‘spills over’ to the main body. Body parts are treated like a separate entity sharing the monstrosity’s space for targeting. You can either effect the body part or the main monster (aoe attacks don’t hit both, for example)."
