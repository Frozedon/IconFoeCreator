      "Description": "If fighting scavengers, place 3 valuables tokens on the battlefield. Valuables are intangible tokens that can be picked up by any character by moving over their space. Characters drop them when defeated, or can drop them voluntarily as 1 action. When the fight ends, each character gains 1 dust for every 3 total valuables tokens the party has, then destroy all valuables tokens."
