      "Description": "Scavengers are kin, can be bargained with, and will flee or surrender if heavily outnumbered or heavily losing a fight.\n• Motivations: Scavengers are typically after the wealth in the ruins and won’t fight if terms can be reached.\n• Flee: If a Scavenger has 4 or more valuables tokens, they attempt to flee the battlefield, fleeing successfully if they start their turn in an edge space of the battlefield with no hostile characters adjacent."

      "Description": "If fighting scavengers, place 3 valuables tokens on the battlefield. Valuables are intangible tokens that can be picked up by any character by moving over their space. Characters drop them when defeated, or can drop them voluntarily as 1 action. At the end of an expedition, all characters gain 1 dust for every 2 valuables tokens the party has as a whole."
