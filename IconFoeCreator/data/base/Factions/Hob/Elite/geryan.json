The terms of the bargain are hidden until they trigger. Accepting a bargain is voluntary, and the Geryan can only offer a bargain once a round.\n- Luck: Trigger: The foe started their turn. Effect: The foe gains +1 boon on all attacks and saves this turn. Terms: The Geryan recharges all its abilities.\n- Immortality: Trigger: Foe just took a wound. Effect: The character can ignore the wound. Terms: The Geryan grants vigor 2 to itself or an ally in range 6.\n- Wealth: Trigger: The foe's turn started. Effect: Place a wealth token in a free space of the Geryan's choice in range 6. The wealth token is an intangible summon. It can be picked up if any character ends its turn adjacent with no other characters adjacent to the token, and is dropped in an adjacent space if a character is defeated. If a character ends combat with the wealth token, they gain 2 dust.\n- Beauty: Trigger: The foe just took damage. Effect: The foe reduces all that damage to 1. Their skin and hair/fur become clean and look amazing. Terms: Every ally of the Geryan in range 3 of that foe gains hatred of them and they become branded and vulnerable."
