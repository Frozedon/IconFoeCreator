      "Description": "Imperials are kin, can be bargained with, and will flee or surrender if heavily outnumbered or heavily losing a fight.\n• Motivations: Imperials have orders they are following from whatever guild master, warlord, or under-baron they serve. Usually this is to capture a location, object of power, or person of interest. If characters can work around those orders, Imperials can usually be bargained with or even be helpful.\n• Flee: When the commanding officer of an Imperial detachment is defeated, there's a 20% chance at the start of each round the remaining imperials will attempt to flee or will surrender on the spot."
