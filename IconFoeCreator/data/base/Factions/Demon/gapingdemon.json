While swallowed, they share their space with the Mouth Demon, they are intangible and untargetable to characters other than the Gaping Demon, their max speed is 0, and the only character they can target other than themselves is the Gaping Demon. At the start of each of their turns, they take [D] piercing damage, and at the end of their turn they can save against this effect. Saving against this effect places them in a free adjacent space. It also ends if the Demon is defeated."
